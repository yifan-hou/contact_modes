	abstract = {We develop robust methods that allow speciﬁcation, control, and transition of a multi-legged robot’s stepping pattern—its gait—during active locomotion over natural terrain. Resulting gaits emerge through the introduction of controllers that impose appropriately-placed repellors within the space of gaits, the torus of relative leg phases, thereby mitigating against dangerous patterns of leg timing. Moreover, these repellors are organized with respect to a natural cellular decomposition of gait space and result in limit cycles with associated basins that are well characterized by these cells, thus conferring a symbolic character upon the overall behavioral repertoire. These ideas are particularly applicable to four- and six-legged robots, for which a large variety of interesting and useful (and, in many cases, familiar) gaits exist, and whose tradeoﬀs between speed and reliability motivate the desire for transitioning between them during active locomotion. We provide an empirical instance of this gait regulation scheme by application to a climbing hexapod, whose “physical layer” sensor-feedback control requires adequate grasp of a climbing surface but whose closed loop control perturbs the robot from its desired gait. We document how the regulation scheme secures the desired gait and permits operator selection of diﬀerent gaits as required during active climbing on challenging surfaces.},

This paper introduces a new formalism for coordination of periodic tasks, with specific application to gait transitions for legged platforms. Specifically, we make modest use of classical group theory to replace combinatorial search and optimization with a computationally simpler and conceptually more straightforward appeal to elementary algebra.We decompose the space of all periodic legged gaits into a cellular complex indexed using “Young Tableaux”, making transparent the proximity to steady state orbits and the neighborhood structure. We encounter the simple task of transitioning between these gaits while locomoting over level ground. Toward that end, we arrange a family of dynamical reference generators over the “Gait Complex” and construct automated coordination controllers to force the legged system to converge to a specified cell’s gait, while assessing the relative static stability of gaits by approximating their stability margin via transit through a “Stance Complex”. To integrate these two different constructs–the Gait Complex describing possible gaits, the Stance Complex defining safe locomotion–we utilize our compositional lexicon to plan switching policies for a hybrid control approach. Results include automated gait transitions for a variety of useful gaits, shown via tests on a hexapedal robot.},

Such vector fields arise not only in biomechanics, but also in robotics, neuroscience, and electrical engineering, to name a few domains of application. Under the conditions that (i) the vector field's discontinuities are locally confined to a finite number of smooth submanifolds and (ii) the vector field is transverse to these surfaces in an appropriate sense, it is known that the vector field yields a well--defined flow that is Lipschitz continuous. We extend these results by showing this flow is piecewise--differentiable, so that it admits a first--order approximation (known as a Bouligand derivative) that is piecewise--linear and continuous at every point. We exploit this first--order approximation to infer existence of piecewise--differentiable impact maps (including Poincaré maps for periodic orbits), show that the flow is locally conjugate (via a piecewise--differentiable homeomorphism) to a flowbox, and assess the effect of perturbations (both infinitesimal and non--infinitesimal) on the flow. We use these results to give a sufficient condition for the exponential stability of a periodic orbit passing through a point of multiply intersecting events and apply the theory in illustrative examples to demonstrate synchronization in first-- and second--order phase oscillator models abstracted from the legged locomotion application domain that motivated our interest in this class of models.},

In the end, the results are combined to develop inverse and implicit function theorems for piecewise differentiable equations.

Then, the value functions associated with overlapping regions are compared in order to discard those regions whose associated control law is never optimal.

(Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum) "From the publication of the first printing, in 1994, this book became one of the most widely used textbooks in Discrete Geometry. The reviewer sees at least two reasons for that: the beautiful mathematics presented here, and the fact that the book can be used at a wide variety of levels, for several different courses. … It is not only students who can benefits from the book. Researchers will find its updates notes and references very helpful." (Miklós Bóna, MathDL, August, 2007)},
